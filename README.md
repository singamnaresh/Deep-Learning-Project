# Deep-Learning-Project

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Learning project as part of an internship program. The project focuses on either Image Classification or Natural Language Processing (NLP), utilizing either TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Project Goal:

The primary goal is to implement a functional deep learning model capable of performing either image classification or a chosen NLP task.

Instructions:

Implement a Deep Learning model for:
    * Image Classification 
    * Natural Language Processing
Use either:
    * TensorFlow
    * PyTorch
Deliverable:A functional model with visualizations of the results.

Contents:

This repository will contain the following:

Code:The Python scripts implementing the chosen deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Data:(If applicable) Instructions or scripts for downloading or preparing the dataset used for training and evaluation.
Model:(Potentially) Saved weights or the trained model.
Visualizations:Scripts or generated images showcasing the results of the model (e.g., accuracy plots, confusion matrices for image classification, examples of model predictions for NLP).
README.md:This file providing an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and details about the implementation.

Completion:

Upon successful completion of this task and submission of the functional model with visualizations, a completion certificate will be issued at the end of the internship.

Organization:

The repository will be organized in a clear and logical manner to facilitate understanding and execution of the project.
